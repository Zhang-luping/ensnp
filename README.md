np_w.pep and np_w.py are the designed program according to the membrane controller for wall following in the reference ( C. Buiu, C. Vasile and O. Arsene, Development of
membrane controllers for mobile robots, Inform. Sciences 187 (2012) 33â€“51.)
ew,pep and ew.py are the designed program of the ENSNP membrane controller with assigned cruising speeds in our paper with the title "Enzymatic Numerical Spiking Neural Membrane Systems
and Their Application in Designing Membrane Controllers".
iew.pep and iew.py are the designed program of the improved ENSNP membrane controller in our paper with the title "Enzymatic Numerical Spiking Neural Membrane Systems
and Their Application in Designing Membrane Controllers".
